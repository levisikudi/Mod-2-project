PROJECT PHILOSOPHY ‚Ä¢ TECH STACK ‚Ä¢ FUNCTIONALITY

## üßê Project philosophy
The Sikudi Store Project is a begginer project that demonstrates the power of MongoDB used in tandem with Express as a reliable data storage and routing system. 

It has the potential of growing if applied with other technologies such as React, Vue or Angular. 


## üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack
Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Sikudi app uses:

This App uses the basic HTML CSS and Vanilla Javascript Front End Development. As my main focus was getting more familiar with backend routing and storage, It does not use any CSS libraries.

For persistent storage (database), the app uses Mongoose which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database. It eventually connects to MongoDB which it uses to store its various channels of information

Additionaly the App uses Express routing to manage server side and client side requests and responses.

The app uses the font Raleway as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.


## üåü Functionality
Through routing, the app acts as a basic skeletal model of an E-commerce site which enables CRUD functionality;
- Creating Products
- Displaying Products
- Updating Product Information
- Deleting Products

All in a friendly UI.
